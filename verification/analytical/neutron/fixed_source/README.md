# Analytical Neutron Fixed-Source Verification

This suite verifies MC/DC neutron transport using multigroup fixed-source cases with analytical reference solutions.
It exercises geometry tracking, surface crossings, material lookup, source sampling, particle transport, and tallying.
Verification checks for the expected $N^{-1/2}$ statistical convergence as the number of source particles increases.

The suite can be executed independently or as part of the top-level MC/DC-VVP workflow.

util.py             Provide shared processing and plotting utilities
```

Each case contains a common set of files:

```text
input.py            Define and run the MC/DC model
reference.py        Generate the analytical reference solution
process.py          Evaluate convergence across the study
plot.py             Inspect one MC/DC result against the reference
```

## Configuration

The `task.yaml` file selects the cases and defines the particle-count range and number of tasks for each case.
One task is one MC/DC execution at one generated `N_particle` value.
An optional `walltime_factor` scales the launch-level walltime for an individual HPC case and defaults to `1.0`.
The base walltime is specified in hours, and the scaled value is rounded up to the scheduler resolution and limited by the platform maximum.
Local execution ignores walltime.
Edit this file to change the study without modifying the launch or processing scripts.

HPC runs use the shared platform settings in the repository's `configs/platform_config.py` and the user-specific settings in `configs/user_config.py`.
The `N_node` option sets the number of nodes, with all available CPU cores used on each node.

## Launching and processing

From this suite directory, launch the study locally:

```bash
python launch.py
```

Launch the study on a supported HPC platform:

```bash
python launch.py --platform tuolumne --N_node 1
```

Use `--walltime HOURS` to set the base walltime.
Cases with every expected MC/DC output are omitted from the Maestro study, while partially complete cases run only their missing particle levels.
Run `python cleanup.py` before launching to remove existing case outputs and start the suite fresh.
Cleanup also removes processed results, generated Maestro run directories, and the untracked `study.yaml`.

After all jobs have completed, process the latest Maestro run:

```bash
python process.py
```

Pass a Maestro run directory to process a specific run:

```bash
python process.py maestro_run_<timestamp>
```

Convergence figures are written to `results/convergence/`.
Comparisons using each case's largest particle count are written to `results/comparison/`, with time-dependent comparisons stored as GIF animations.
The top-level `process.py` collects these figures under the repository's `results/` directory.

### MMS two-group slab

This steady-state, one-dimensional problem uses a 10 cm slab with vacuum boundaries, two energy groups, and isotropic scattering.
Both groups have $\Sigma_t=1$ cm$^{-1}$ and $\Sigma_c=0.6$ cm$^{-1}$, and every entry of the outgoing-by-incoming scattering matrix is $0.2$ cm$^{-1}$.
We manufacture the right-hand sides (sum of in-scattering and non-homogeneous source) of the group-wise transport equation:

$$
R_1(x)=0.5+0.01x,
\qquad
R_2(x)=0.6-0.01x.
$$

The equal-and-opposite slopes yield isotropic incoming boundary fluxes and the positive, angle-integrated volume sources

$$
q_1(x)=0.56+0.02x,
\qquad
q_2(x)=0.76-0.02x.
$$

MC/DC samples these sources with piecewise-linear spatial distributions and the incoming fluxes with white half-space boundary sources.
The analytical scalar flux is $\phi_g(x)=2R_g(x)+R'_g(x)[E_3(x)-E_3(10-x)]$.

### SHEM-361 multigroup data

The SHEM-361 cases use `data/SHEM-361.npz` as their multigroup cross-section dataset.
The dataset was generated by homogenizing a continuous-energy calculation of an infinite lattice of borated PWR fuel pin cells onto the SHEM-361 energy-group structure.
