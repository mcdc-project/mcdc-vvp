# Neutron Code-to-Code Verification

This suite compares neutron transport results from multiple independently implemented codes.
The current participating codes are MC/DC and OpenMC, and the workflow is intended to accommodate additional codes.
It exercises time-dependent multigroup transport, moving geometry, delayed neutrons, void streaming, and multidimensional space-time tallies.
The arithmetic mean of the participating code estimates at the largest sampling level defines the fixed comparison reference for every level.
The reported metrics are the pair-averaged L2 norm and maximum absolute pairwise relative difference normalized by that fixed reference.
Verification checks for $N^{-1/2}$ decay in both metrics as the participating calculations scale their sampling efforts together.
Observing that rate supports that the codes are converging statistically toward the same solution, while a plateau can indicate bias or a modeling discrepancy.
Agreement does not by itself establish correctness because independently implemented codes can still share a common bias.

The suite can be executed independently or as part of the top-level MC/DC-VVP workflow.

Each case contains a common set of files:

```text

reference.py        Obtain participating-code comparison outputs
process.py          Evaluate code-to-code convergence
plot.py             Plot or animate participating-code results
```

## Configuration

The `task.yaml` file selects the cases and defines the particle-count range and number of tasks for each case.
One task is one MC/DC execution at one generated `N_particle` value, paired during processing with the corresponding result from every participating code.
Each case defines a `walltime_factor` that scales the launch-level walltime for HPC execution.
The base walltime is specified in hours, and the scaled value is rounded up to the scheduler resolution and limited by the platform maximum.
For example, a base of `1.5` hours gives C5G7 1 hour 30 minutes and Kobayashi 45 minutes.
Local execution ignores walltime.
Each case uses 30 batches, matching the corresponding participating-code campaign.
Processing reads the batch count from each output and multiplies it by the particle count per batch to obtain the total number of histories.
The largest particle-count task supplies the participating results used to construct the fixed comparison reference.

The OpenMC statepoints are canonical external comparison data because they are too large to track in this repository.
Download and checksum them from their Zenodo records before processing:

```bash
python cases/c5g7-4phase/reference.py
python cases/kobayashi/reference.py
```

HPC runs use the shared platform settings in the repository's `configs/platform_config.py` and the user-specific settings in `configs/user_config.py`.
The `N_node` option sets the number of nodes, with all available CPU cores used on each node.

## Launching and processing

From this suite directory, launch the study locally:

```bash
python launch.py
```

Launch the study on a supported HPC platform:

```bash
python launch.py --platform tuolumne --N_node 1
```

Use `--walltime HOURS` to set the base walltime.
Cases with all five MC/DC outputs are omitted from the Maestro study, while partially complete cases run only their missing particle levels.
Run `python cleanup.py` before launching to remove existing case outputs and start the suite fresh.
Cleanup also removes processed results, generated Maestro run directories, and the untracked `study.yaml`.

After all jobs have completed and the participating-code comparison data are available, process the latest Maestro run:

```bash
python process.py
```

Pass a Maestro run directory to process a specific run:

```bash
python process.py maestro_run_<timestamp>
```

Convergence figures are written to `results/convergence/`.
Fixed-reference figures and animations are written to `results/reference/`.
Animated spatial comparisons and relative-difference evolution at the largest shared sample size are written to `results/comparison/`.
Each case may produce `reference_*.png` figures or `reference_*.gif` animations from the arithmetic mean of the largest-sample participating-code estimates.
Spatial cases produce `comparison.gif` and `difference.gif`; detector histories produce `comparison.png` and `difference.png`.
The top-level `process.py` collects these figures under the repository's `results/` directory.

Each case's `plot.py` can inspect participating-code results at a selected sampling level using their largest-sample estimates as the fixed comparison reference:

```bash
python cases/kobayashi/plot.py \
    cases/kobayashi/output_100000000.h5 \
    cases/kobayashi/reference/output_0.h5 \
    cases/kobayashi/output_10000000000.h5 \
    cases/kobayashi/reference/output_4.h5
```

## Cases

| Case | Description |
| :--- | :---------- |
| [`c5g7-4phase`](cases/c5g7-4phase/) | Four-phase C5G7 transient with a pulsed source and continuously moving control rods. |
| [`kobayashi`](cases/kobayashi/) | Pulsed three-dimensional Kobayashi dog-leg shielding problem with a void channel. |
| [`kobayashi-detector`](cases/kobayashi-detector/) | Pulsed multiplying dog-leg problem with a time-resolved detector capture tally. |

### Four-phase C5G7 transient

This seven-group problem adapts the heterogeneous C5G7-TD core into four source- and control-rod-driven phases over 20 seconds.
The quantity of interest is the pin-pitch-resolved space-time fission-rate distribution.
The MC/DC model uses the canonical cross sections in `data/MGXS-C5G7.h5`, while the OpenMC statepoints are provided by the associated Zenodo record.

### Time-dependent Kobayashi dog-leg

The `kobayashi` case adapts the steady-state, one-group Kobayashi shielding benchmark by pulsing an isotropic source uniformly over time [0, 50] in a 10 × 10 × 10 source region.
Particles stream through a three-dimensional dog-leg channel containing a weakly interacting material, surrounded by a scattering and absorbing shield.
The quantities of interest are the space-time flux distribution on a unit-spaced three-dimensional mesh and the total neutron density, recorded in 100 time bins over [0, 200].
The OpenMC statepoints for this baseline case are provided by the associated Zenodo record.

The `kobayashi-detector` case extends this model with localized prompt-fission multiplication and a detector response at the channel exit.
It retains the outer dimensions, dog-leg channel layout, source pulse, unit neutron speed, and reflective and vacuum outer boundary conditions of the baseline.
A 10 cm fuel cube occupies x = [30, 40], y = [50, 60], z = [0, 10] at the second channel turn.
The fuel has scattering and fission cross sections of 0.05 each, zero capture, and prompt fission multiplicity 2.5.
A 10 cm detector cube occupies x = [30, 40], y = [90, 100], z = [30, 40] at the outlet and uses the shield material.
These material, geometry, and source definitions match `mcdc/examples/kobayashi-dogleg/pulsed_with_fission/input.py`.

The detector variant scores only capture integrated over the detector volume and each time bin, normalized per source particle.
It replaces the baseline flux-map and density tallies with 500 unit-width time bins over [0, 500], extending the observation window and refining the time resolution.
